How to use Using the extension in WSO2 Stream Processor You can use this extension in the latest WSO2 Stream Processor that is a part of WSO2 Analytics offering, with editor, debugger and simulation support. This extension is shipped by default with WSO2 Stream Processor, if you wish to use an alternative version of this extension you can replace the component jar that can be found in the STREAM_PROCESSOR_HOME /lib directory. Using the extension as a java library This extension can be added as a maven dependency along with other Siddhi dependencies to your project. dependency groupId org.wso2.extension.siddhi.execution.stats /groupId artifactId siddhi-execution-stats /artifactId version x.x.x /version /dependency Jenkins Build Status Branch Build Status master Features median ( Aggregate Function ) This extension returns the median of aggregated events. As the calculation of the median is performed with the arrival and expiry of each event, it is not recommended to use this extension for large window sizes. How to Contribute Please report issues at GitHub Issue Tracker . Send your contributions as pull requests to master branch . Contact us Post your questions with the \"Siddhi\" tag in Stackoverflow . Siddhi developers can be contacted via the mailing lists: Developers List : dev@wso2.org Architecture List : architecture@wso2.org Support We are committed to ensuring support for this extension in production.
